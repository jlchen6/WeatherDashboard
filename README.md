# WeatherDashboard

User can enter a city name and find out both the current weather and the five day forecast for that city. 

## Added Feature
* Added a feature to format the entered city name so that the history doesn't contain both lowercase and uppercase entries for the same city.
* Added code to alert the user if they enter a city that isn't found by the weather API.
